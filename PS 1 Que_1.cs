2. 5.0 - double
3. 5 > 1 - bool
4. '5' - char
5. 5 * 2 - int
6. '5' * 2 - int (due to implicit conversion of char to its ASCII value)
7. '5' + '2' - int (due to implicit conversion of chars to their ASCII values and addition)
8. 5 / 2 - int (integer division)
9. 5 % 2 - int (remainder after division)
10. {5, 2, 1} - Array of int
11. 5 == 3 - bool
12. Pi(the number) - double (assuming Pi is a variable representing the mathematical constant)
